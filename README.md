# edueda
A simple introduction of EDA modelling (electronic design automation) for educational overview.
It is intended for technological courses on EDA, and is intended to serve as a basis
for starting an EDA project, in which the students are expected to fill the missing details
and add more building blocks.
The GUI applications contained in this code are just rough sketches for how to start.
Nothing is really finalized.
The intention is to let the student get the idea of the python tkinter canvas and text widgets and how
they can be used for designing EDA placement and floorplanning systems.
It also exhibits object oriented disciplines.
The code has been developed as part of several engineering design projects at Ort Braude College, Israel,
and hereby is made available for public use. 

## Dependencies
Note that the code depends on the **xcanvas** and **pytkcon** modules.
These two modules are available from **PyPI**:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi
<br/>
and are easily installed using:
1. pip install xcanvas
2. pip install pytkcon
